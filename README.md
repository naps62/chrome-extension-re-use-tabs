# Re-use tabs

A chrome extension that keeps your browser tidy by re-using your pinned tabs

# What does it actually do?

Right now it does one simple thing:
Whenever you navigate to a URL, it looks for a pinned tab that is pointing to the same domain. If one is found, your current tab closes, and the pinned tab gets focused, with the URL changed to the one you tried to access

# Why?

I have a few websites I constantly need throughout my work day (usually they're Github, Trello & localhost:3000). But I have a bad habit of constantly opening new tabs in these URLs, when I could re-use them. I usually end up with too many of them open, at which point I restart my browser.

This is a first attempt towards improving how I use my browser.
